# 🖥️ Raspberry Pi–Powered Desktop Productivity Dashboard

![ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad89d68-9a67-43f6-b950-0cf1cf5ba336)

Welcome to my productivity dashboard project! This repo contains the code for the display I run on a Raspberry Pi 4 + monitor setup mounted above my desk.

It’s inspired by the MagicMirror project and designed to show just the essentials — clock, calendar, and to-dos — in a clean, distraction-free fullscreen layout.

# 🧠 What It Does
- Displays a fullscreen dashboard in Chromium on Raspbian

- Shows calendar events, clock, and tasks at a glance

- Keeps me focused and on top of upcoming events

# 🧰 Extras
I also have a Sense HAT temperature monitor running on the same Pi, which changes the LED color based on CPU temperature. It’s super simple, but makes sure I don't overheat by accident when working overtime :)

# 📚 Resources
Check out resources.md for some of the tutorials, tools, and references I used while building this.

# 💬 Why I Built This
This was my first hardware + software project, and I wanted to share it for anyone who’s been curious about exploring hardware but felt intimidated (like I was!).

If you're into web dev and want to dip into hardware, I’d definitely recommend something like this — it helped me gain confidence, and now I’m excited to build more.

# 🚀 Try It Yourself
⚠️ Live demo: https://108charlotte.github.io/magic-mirror/
(Note: requires Google sign-in to show your calendar and may show an “unverified app” warning — it’s safe, but if you still don't want to bypass it you can just close out of the popup that opens and the dashboard will work just fine without the calendar!)

# 🙌 Feedback Welcome
I’d love ideas for features, layout improvements, or general feedback — and I’m totally open to contributors!

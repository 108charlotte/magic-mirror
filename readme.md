# Raspberry Pi–Powered Desktop Productivity Dashboard

![ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad89d68-9a67-43f6-b950-0cf1cf5ba336)

Welcome to my productivity dashboard project! This repo contains the code for the display I run on a Raspberry Pi 4 + monitor setup mounted above my desk.

It’s inspired by the MagicMirror project and designed to show just the essentials — clock, calendar, and to-dos — in a clean, distraction-free fullscreen layout.

# Functionality
- Displays a fullscreen dashboard in Chromium on Raspbian

- Shows calendar events, clock, and tasks at a glance

- Keeps me focused and on top of upcoming events

I also have a Sense HAT temperature monitor running on the same Pi, which changes the LED color based on CPU temperature, to make sure I don't overheat by accident :)

# Resources
Check out resources.md for some of the tutorials, tools, and references I used while building this.

# Why
This was my first hardware + software project, and I wanted to share it for anyone who’s been curious about exploring hardware but felt intimidated (like I was!).

If you're into web dev and want to dip into hardware, I’d definitely recommend something like this — it helped me gain a lot of confidence, and definitely inspired me to look deeper into hardware.

# Try It Yourself

(Note: requires Google sign-in to show your calendar and may show an “unverified app” warning — it’s safe, but if you still don't want to bypass it you can just close out of the popup that opens and the dashboard will work just fine without the calendar!)

I’d love ideas for features, layout improvements, or general feedback — I’m also open to contributors!

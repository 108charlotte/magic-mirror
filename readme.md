## Magic Mirror/Smart Display Project

Welcome to my magic mirror project! This repo is the code for the display for a raspberry pi 4 + monitor setup I created in my room! In addition to just the pi and the monitor, I also have a senseHAT constantly checking if the cpu temp is at a safe level and reporting back by changing the colors of the LEDs (that's in the senseHAT-temp-monitor repo if you want to check it out, its super simple tho, this was the bulk of the project)! On the raspberry pi, I am running a basic raspian desktop, but I typically have it open to chromium with this display up! I called it a magic mirror because its inspired by similar raspberry pi-powered monitor projects designed to give you access to important information at a glance. Check out my resources.md to see some of the resources I used in creating this project, and I hope you like it! Also let me know if you have any ideas for improvements or cool new features I could implement! 

* this is also my first hardware + software project, so for anyone who's scared about checking out hardware I would definitely recommend doing something like this which combines both to get more comfortable with it--after this, I definitely want to explore more, and maybe you will too!
